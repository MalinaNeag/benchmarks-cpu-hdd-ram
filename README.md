# Benchmarking Project

This project is a faculty project implemented in Java that includes several types of benchmarks. A benchmark is a standardized test used to evaluate the performance of a system, such as a CPU or a computer program. Benchmarks are important because they provide a quantitative measure of performance, which can be used to compare different systems or to identify performance bottlenecks.

## Project Framework

The project is implemented using a benchmarking framework that includes several packages:

### Logging

The logging package is responsible for logging the results of the benchmarks. 

### Timing

The timing package provides a way to measure the execution time of a particular piece of code. It includes utilities for converting between different time units.

### Testbench

The testbench package provides a way to run a test for a particular algorithm or data structure.

### Bench

The bench package provides the algorithms for the benchmarks.

## Types of Benchmarks

The following types of benchmarks are performed in this project:

## CPU Testing

### Generating the PI digits with Gauss Legendre. 

This benchmark measures the performance of the CPU in terms of floating point arithmetic and computational efficiency.

### Fixed Point Arithmetic (MOPS)

The Fixed Point Arithmetic benchmark measures the performance of integer arithmetic, arrays, and branching. It calculates the number of millions of operations per second (MOPS) that the CPU can perform.

### Recursion and Caching Testing 

The Recursion and Caching Testing benchmark uses the loop unrolling technique to improve performance.

### Threaded Roots using Newton's Formula

The Threaded Roots benchmark measures the performance of threaded programming. It uses Newton's formula to calculate the square roots of a number.

### Dynamic Workload with Threads

The Dynamic Workload benchmark measures the performance of dynamic workload using threads. It uses brute force attack to decipher a given hash.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive benchmarking framework for measuring the performance of different algorithms and data structures.
